* Lambda is a compute service that lets you run yuor code without managing servers.

- Lambda Manages:-
1. Provisioning and capacity of the compute fleets. (CPU, Network and other resources)
2. Server and OS maintaince.
3. High availabilty and autoscaling 
4. Monitoring health
5. Deploing a code 
6. Monitoring your Lambda function

- Lambda execte your code when needed scale automatically from a few request per day to thousand per second.
- You Pay only for the compute time you will consume. No charge when your code is not running.

- Lambda supports language:- 
Nodejs, Java, Python, Ruby, C#, Powershell, Go, .net only

* How Lambda works:
1. First you upload your code to lambda in one or more lambda function.
2. AWS Lambda will execute the code.
3. After code involed lambda automatically take care of provisioning and managing the required servers.

Lambda Function: That code that you want lambda to run is known as Lambda funtion.
